# Natural-Language-Processing-To-understand-the-concept
This project uses base concepts of NLP, this project does not have any model in it. My main idea was to show the base concept of NLP.

# No prerequisite required for this project

# How to use the code ?
You can either use Anaconda, Pycharm, Jupyter notebook or Google colab to run the code. (I personally prefer Google Colab) 

# Process to execute the code:-
1. Download the above code
2. Run  "python file_name.py" on your console.
3. That would be all !!
